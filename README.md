# Basic-algorithms-implementation-using-python
This repository is for my own python implementation for some basic algorithms. All the algorithms were implemented following the procedures introduced in CLRS (Introduction to Algorithm) book. My implementation might not be perfect. But, hey! :)  
## Sorting algorithms
* insert sort
* merge sort
* Heap sort
* Quick sort
* Radix & counting sort (counting sort is used as a subroutine of radix sort)
## Dynamic programming
* maximum subarray
## Tree algorithm
* Breadth first search (BFS)
* Depth first search (DFS)
